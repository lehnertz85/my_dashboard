# plex_dashboard
A dashboard for Plex related services -- using Django
    * could be used for other things too.

Still in development. More to come!

Everything is working. Some cleanup is needed. There is a TODO list.
   1. Login screen w/ change password and add user(?)
   2. Convert to one view *probably won't do this, but maybe
   3. Create update mechanism
   4. maybe create installers with [pyinstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/), or stick with git
